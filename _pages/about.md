**Non-Standard Experiments in Anthropology, the Social Sciences, and Cosmology**

We wish to think both “in” and “with” the Universe, its periodicities, vibrations, and symmetries, beyond the Modern. A superposition of experimental sciences, indigenous and ancient knowledges, rooted in a commitment to the description of reality and the reality of description. All thinking is a thinking with Others, and all thinking is a reciprocity: these are the oscillations of a thought in-Universe.

From the Moderns, we have inherited a way of thinking and doing that has been disastrous for the human. We contend that many of the pressing problems of our time, including climate change and global inequality, are direct consequences of the cosmology of the Moderns. As a platform for research and publication, one of our aims is to highlight experiments that attempt to diagnose and resolve the aporias of the Modern Constitution and the problems it engenders.

The fragility of the nature/culture schema that organizes the division of the natural and social sciences requires new disciplinary configurations, new styles of doing research and engagement. Non-Standard thinking does not prejudge the affordances of its theoretical materials, their possible usages and combinations, but seeks the place of invention.

No return to the Enlightenment, no return to tradition: simply return to the Universe. Oscillations thinks a time that is as eternal as it is contemporary, as ancient as it is futural. Even as oscillations aims to intervene in the now, oscillations roots itself in the deep time of the Universe.
