The Sky is falling and there are too few who would recognize the importance of holding it up. We have inherited a way of thinking and doing that has been disastrous for the human. Many of the pressing problems of our time, including climate change and global inequality, are a direct consequence of the cosmology of the Moderns. We need to rebuild the World Tree, to learn again to live well between Sky and Earth.

Oscillations invites contributions to the project of a generic cosmological thinking, thinking with polytheistic, animist, and other practices that may be taken as “unserious” by the Modern orthodoxy. We do not reject Modern sciences and knowledges but seek to think with them without their overdetermining exclusivity and narcissism.

We need to think with the Universe. We no longer maintain an exclusive relationship between the self and the other, the subject and the object of analysis, but explore a radical and mutual inclusion, grounded in the shared singularity of the Human.

Thought is radically unbound, and beyond what can be conceived at any moment. It is grounded in nothing else but the Center of the Universe, where and what we are.

We are seeking contributions that seek to reconfigure our notions of the human, the animal, technology, and divinity by creating linkages across science, philosophy, myth, and other practices. We are interested in a science of form, symmetry, and transformation, in order to think the reciprocities of thinking, as holograms of the universe.

Possible topics include:

-   World-making and world-building; dialectics and (in)commensurabilities; decolonial metaphysics
-   Non-western philosophies, mythologies and cosmogonies; perspectivism, Amerindian or otherwise; Indigenous and Afrocentric thought: pessimisms, optimisms, and futurisms
-   Ecological thinking; animal, plant, and nonhuman subjectivities; space exploration and inter-planetary design
-   A(G)I; networked thought; quantum, multiverse and string theory; big bang theory
-   Cosmotechnics; formalism and ultra-rationalism; thinking with artifacts, images and diagrams
-   Mysticism; religious and spiritual practices; alchemy, plant medicines and entheogens; numerology and mathematics; fractal geometry and sacred geometry

Oscillations is open to a variety of discursive modalities and genres:

-   Non-standard literary and multimedia forms; cosmo- and science-fiction; ethnographic invention; research notes; interviews and reviews; poetry, incantation and code
